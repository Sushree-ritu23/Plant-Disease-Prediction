# 🌿PLANT DISEASE PREDICTION 
A deep learning project that helps identify plant diseases from leaf images. Just upload a picture of a leaf, and the model predicts the disease in seconds. It's built to support farmers and gardening enthusiasts in keeping their plants healthy!
## ✨ Key Features
- **🔍 Image-Based Disease Detection**: Upload a photo of a plant leaf, and the system predicts the disease with high accuracy.

- **🧠 Deep Learning Powered**: Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for effective pattern recognition.

- **🌿 Multiple Crop Support**: Capable of identifying diseases in various plant types.

- **📊 User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit for smooth interaction.

- **⚡ Real-Time Prediction**: Fast processing and instant results on image upload.

- **🧪 Trained on Large Dataset**: Uses a well-structured and diverse dataset for improved model accuracy.
